# hh_resume_pull
A python script that parses a hh.ru CV and saves it to a .csv file. Script has a GUI based on tkinter.

Script takes data from the clipboard and creates a database.csv in project directory.

FIXME:
1. When browser window is shrinked, right column interferes with the left. and results in a hot mess
2. Windows version lacks: workaround of "Сейчас на сайте"
